# Category Management Enhancements - Initial Spec Idea

## Raw Feature Description

Advanced category organization tools including:
- Category deletion with event migration options
- Category merging functionality (consolidate multiple categories)
- Category usage statistics and event counts

## Context

This is part of Phase 1: Complete Single-User Experience. The event categories system already exists with backend complete and frontend working. Users can already create, edit, and assign categories to events. Categories are scoped to individual calendars and have translatable content (names/descriptions in multiple languages).

## Roadmap Reference

From roadmap.md Phase 1:
- Category deletion with event migration options
- Category merging functionality (consolidate multiple categories)
- Category usage statistics and event counts

Effort estimate: S (2-3 days)
