## Feature Description

Advanced category organization tools including:
- Category deletion with event migration options
- Category merging functionality (consolidate multiple categories)
- Category usage statistics and event counts

## Context

This feature is part of Phase 1 of the roadmap: "Complete Single-User Experience". It builds on the existing event categories system which has a complete backend API with frontend filtering UI already implemented.

## Roadmap Position

From the Phase 1 Should-Have features, this enhancement will complete the category management capabilities by adding advanced organization tools that calendar owners need to maintain clean, well-organized category systems over time.
