## User's Description

"lets spend some time QA'ing event location management (assigning to an event, re-using past locations on the same calendar, etc.)"

## Initial Context

This spec focuses on quality assurance testing of the event location management functionality, including:
- Assigning locations to events
- Re-using previously created locations on the same calendar
- Overall location management workflow

This is a QA/testing focused spec rather than a new feature implementation.
